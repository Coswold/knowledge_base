#### Meditations

1. Interestng that Marcus mentions his great grandfather speaking 
of avoiding public schools and searching for great teachers.

2. Marcus mentions many times the ability of great men to match the
"level" of other men. Specifically, Marcus says about Maximus, "No 
man would ever feel despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think 
himself a better man."

3. Another theme of great men according to marcus is the ability to
go without passion yet express affection. 

4. Also very interesting that he was told to not speak about how busy 
he constantly was or how much work he had to do. Many things he speaks 
of seem to be very prevolent in todays society. Alexander the Platonic 
also told him to not blame urgent occupations for the neglect of close 
relationships.

5. Maximus seemed to have much influence on Marcus and is one of my favorite
idols to read about. He is said to be cheerful in all situations while 
still respected by great men and lesser men alike. Maximus seemed to be 
very genuine and Marcus explains how he observed that people truly believed
that he thought as he spoke.
